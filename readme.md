# Wadjet Client

This is the client TUI for my Wadjet Project!

# Wadjet

I'm writing a tool to register all my projects and applications, as well as tracking what projects are running on each ports and be able to kill/run them from anywhere on my terminal

To do so I'm writing an application split in two, a Daemon that will run on the background and this client to connect to it, it's a hobby project to learn how to develop Terminal UI applications.
